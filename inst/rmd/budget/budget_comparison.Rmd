## Total

### Funding guaranteed (phases 0-2)

- Old (SBU-funded): `r sum(budget$usd[budget$partner == 'WeRobotics' & budget$phase <=2 & budget$key == 'Old' & budget$source == 'SBU'])`
- Old (WR in-kind): `r sum(budget$usd[budget$partner == 'WeRobotics' & budget$phase <=2 & budget$key == 'Old' & budget$source == 'WeRobotics'])`
- New (SBU-funded): `r sum(budget$usd[budget$partner == 'WeRobotics' & budget$phase <=2 & budget$key == 'New' & budget$source == 'SBU'])`
- New (WR in-kind): `r sum(budget$usd[budget$partner == 'WeRobotics' & budget$phase <=2 & budget$key == 'New' & budget$source == 'WeRobotics'])`

## Explanation of differences

### Overview

- Phase 1: Due to administrative delays, more money has to be alloted for phase 1 (ground operations) in order to account for the fact that it has increased from 6 to 8 months.
- Phase 2: Relative to the previous budget, less money has been allotted for phase 2 (air operations) in order to account for the fact that this phase has decreased in duration from 6 to 3 months.

```{r}
x <- budget %>%
  filter(partner == 'WeRobotics',
         phase <= 2) %>%
  group_by(source, key) %>%
  summarise(usd = sum(usd))
left <- expand.grid(phase = 1:2,
                    key = c('New', 'Old'))
x <- left_join(left, x)

```

## Differences by item

### Overview 

- Changes to phase 1 are largely irrelevant to WeRobotics (since almost all phase 1 operations are carried out by SBU and BNMT).

- Phase 2 is largely characterized by decreases in HR expenditures, due to the reduction in phase length from 6 to 3 months. Equipment and materials costs, as well as the costs of meetings, remain identical. Overhead remains identical (meaning that it's likely too large).

### Breakdown

The below shows an itemized comparison between the old and new budgets. Increases are in blue; decreases are in red. Note: 


```{r}
right <- 
  budget %>%
  filter(partner == 'WeRobotics',
         phase <= 2) %>%
  mutate(source = paste0('Funded by ', source)) %>%
  group_by(item, phase, source) %>%
  summarise(old = sum(usd[key == 'Old']),
            new = sum(usd[key == 'New'])) %>%
  arrange(phase, item) %>%
  mutate(increase = old < new,
         decrease = old > new)
increase <- right$increase
decrease <- right$decrease
right$increase <- right$decrease <- NULL

names(right) <- Hmisc::capitalize(names(right))

library(kableExtra)
k <- kable(right) %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(which(decrease),
           bold = T,
           color = 'white',
           background = '#D7261E') %>%
  row_spec(which(increase),
           bold = T,
           color = 'white',
           background = '#008B8B')
k
```

## Phase 3 

Phase 3 is not yet funded. The plan will be to seek "bridge funding" from the current funder at the beginning of phase 2 (April 2019) so as to expand air operations from 3 to 6 months. If this were approved, then total WeRobotics-associated budget would look like the below (very similar to the July proposal):

```{r}
x <- budget %>%
  filter(partner == 'WeRobotics',
         phase <= 3,
         key == 'New') %>%
  group_by(source, phase) %>%
  summarise(usd = sum(usd))
left <- expand.grid(phase = 1:3,
                    source = c('WeRobotics', 'SBU'))
x <- left_join(left, x)
x$usd[is.na(x$usd)] <- 0
x$source <- paste0('Funding source:\n', x$source)
x$phase <- factor(x$phase)
ggplot(data = x,
       aes(x = source,
           y = usd)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',
           alpha = 0.7,
           position = position_dodge(width = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~phase) +
  geom_label(aes(label = round(usd)),
             position = position_dodge(width = 1)) +
  theme_databrew() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  labs(x = 'Phase',
       y = 'USD') 
```


## Raw data


### Old version

```{r}
prettify(budget %>% filter(partner == 'WeRobotics',
                           key == 'Old'), 
         download_options = TRUE)
```

### New version


```{r}
prettify(budget %>% filter(partner == 'WeRobotics',
                           key == 'New',
                           phase <= 2), 
         download_options = TRUE)
```


### Full new version (including phase 3)


```{r}
prettify(budget %>% filter(partner == 'WeRobotics',
                           key == 'New',
                           phase <= 3), 
         download_options = TRUE)
```
